# Statitics for the SLDB.GG Service
The Statistics Service for Shatterline Database (SLDB)

## READ THIS BEFORE USING OUR STATISTICS
- Please read the license carefully, there is no documentation available yet so I discourage you from using our data on your projects.
- Submitting data should be done via Discord and not manually via Github as there is no documentation yet
- There is no point in using our data for your own project currently, most of the data here is "Incomplete" aka some things are missing.
- SLDB.GG's source code isn't public, our data is publically available so anyone could use it in their own projects later.
